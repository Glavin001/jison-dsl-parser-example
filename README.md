Jison DSL parser example
========================

This is a simple shipping DSL parser. It's based on the code mentioned at the end of [this talk](https://github.com/ngreen77/Writing-Custom-DSLs) by Neil Green at JSConf 2014. I've simply written a different implementation of the DSL parser using [Jison](http://zaach.github.io/jison/).

It's a great talk, and should be watched before making sense of this parser.  
The tests should help you understand how the parser works and what it does.
